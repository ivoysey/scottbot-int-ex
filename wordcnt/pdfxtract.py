## this is https://gist.github.com/jmcarp/7105045. the standard docs for
## how to use pdfminer give an example of how to use it, but it's slightly
## busted. this is what the internet seems to have settled on for how to
## interpret that example into code that actually does something.

from pdfminer.pdfinterp import PDFResourceManager, PDFPageInterpreter
from pdfminer.pdfpage import PDFPage
from pdfminer.converter import TextConverter
from pdfminer.layout import LAParams

from cStringIO import StringIO

def pdf_to_text(pdfname):

    # PDFMiner boilerplate
    rsrcmgr = PDFResourceManager()
    sio = StringIO()
    codec = 'utf-8'
    laparams = LAParams()
    device = TextConverter(rsrcmgr, sio, codec=codec, laparams=laparams)
    interpreter = PDFPageInterpreter(rsrcmgr, device)

    # Extract text
    fp = file(pdfname, 'rb')
    for page in PDFPage.get_pages(fp):
        interpreter.process_page(page)
    fp.close()

    # Get text from StringIO
    text = sio.getvalue()

    # Cleanup
    device.close()
    sio.close()

    return text
