options for finding the biggest four things in an unordered collection.

1) sort it by the thing you want to maximize and pick the top (bottom) four
   elements. O(n lg n), but good if you want to a lot of other queries
   into the same thing. also easy to implement and easy to read and see
   that it's correct.

2) write a thing to find the kth element and call it four times. this is
   expected linear with a slightly fancy algorithm that's not trival to
   write or understand. also that means you need to call the same thing
   four times, so it's O(4n).

3) write a fairly delicate thing that gets the kth (or 4 specifically)
   biggest things in exactly one linear pass. getting the 4 biggest things
   isn't the full SELECT problem, it's a special case where you're always
   getting the maximum (prefix). so you don't need to do QuickSelect, but
   it gets a little gross to manage all the indexing and stuff.

4) write a max-finder and lazy-remove things so that you get subsequent
   maxes. hacky but easier to understand / write than (2) probably.
