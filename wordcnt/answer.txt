the task statement leaves a few questions unanswered. in order to get a

 - "words" should be treated modulo things like punctuation and
   capitalization. so "QUEEN" and "queen" and "Queen!" should all be
   treated as the same word appearing in different contexts.

   words that are hyphenated, like "jury-box", are perfectly good words by
   themselves. so that word appears once in the Alice text and doesn't
   increase the counts for the words "jury" or "box"

   non-sense words that might not appear in a dictionary are fine words for
   this question.

 - "alice in wonderland" refers to the actual text of the book, not the
   metatext of a particular version, such as copyright statements, project
   gutenburg text, tables of contents, or chapter headings. so that means

   gutenburg edition, or even more specifically the PDF of the project
   gutenburg edition. the latter introduces some new complications, because
   you have to use some tool to extract the strings from the PDF as strings
   in data before doing anything with it. i'm actually curious to see how
