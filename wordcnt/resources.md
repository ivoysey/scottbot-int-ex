i referred to a bunch of different resources in writing down my solutions
for these tasks. here's the main ones:

 - http://wiki.python.org, for general syntax and style guides

 - the nltk book, http://www.nltk.org/book/, and package documentation for
   nltk

 - https://docs.python.org/ for the API documentation for the modules i used

 - http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/python/pdfminer/programming.html is the
   nearly-complete documentation for how to use the pdfminer package. it's
   not very well written, since everyone seems to try to avoid doing it
   this way as much as they can (and i don't blame them).

   the documentation doesn't include an example of how to actually use the
   library, but https://gist.github.com/jmcarp/7105045 is the one that all
   the wiki pages and other projects that i found that use pdfminer
   reccomend. i used this code wholesale.

 - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/progressbar for the documentation on that
    package, which oddly seems to nto

 - http://stackoverflow.com for small questions about python syntax
