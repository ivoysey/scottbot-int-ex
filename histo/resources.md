i referred to a bunch of different resources in writing down my solutions
for these tasks. here are the main ones:

- this page describes how to use node.js to do authentication to a small
  space
  sanely. https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-setup-and-local
  with code at https://github.com/scotch-io/easy-node-authentication

  i used the code that they describe, found on
  https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started.git, there as my
  starting point, removing some of it and adapting it to my task

- the heroku start up docs, largely from
  https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs

- the d3.js docs, at https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki
