Some features that this site doesn't currently have and probably should:

- checking to see that the email address is actual an email address

- checking the password for strength and enforcing some sort of policy
  about that

- emailing the password with a link to the new profile to check that it's
  not just a syntactically correct email but one that the person signing up
  for actually has access to
