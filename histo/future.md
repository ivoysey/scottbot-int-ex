Some features that this site doesn't currently have and probably should:

- make the input of the age thing date of birth, not a string, so you can
  check the current date at the time of render and move points in the
  histogram as they change over time. also hygene check the input of the
  DOB; limit it to

- update the source of the data for the histogram so that it queries the
  database (should be easy)

- checking to see that the email address is actual an email address

- checking the password for strength and enforcing some sort of policy
  about that

- emailing the password with a link to the new profile to check that it's
  not just a syntactically correct email but one that the person signing up
  for actually has access to
