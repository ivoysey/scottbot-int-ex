1. Build a website that allows users to register with their name, password,
and an age. When a user logs in, show them a bar chart histogram of all the
ages of everyone who has registered. For example, if three people have
registered, aged 30, 38, and 30, the bar chart should show two bars; one of
30 at height 2, and one of 38 at height 1. Highlight the bar of the logged
in user in a different color than any of the other bars. (Hint: d3.js and
heroku might work here, if you need ideas for free utilities and hosting.)

2. What are the four most frequent words used in this version of Alice in
Wonderland? How often does the word “Alice” appear on either side of an
adjective? Use any method, language, or library you like. Send a copy of
your well-commented code. (Hint: this uses something called “Part of Speech
tagging” or “POS tagging”, and the NLTK is a great resource.)
